1. Overview
===========

Litiom aims to complement Eliom, the web programming framework part of the
Ocsigen project [1].  Litiom is basically a collection of modules offering
high-level constructs for web programming.  Presently, the library contains
the Litiom_blocks and the Litiom_wizard modules.  Litiom_blocks uses the
arrow formalism to build a simple algebra of Lwt functions plumbed together.
It allows for simple composition of functions, forking & joining, and placing
the result of a list of computations inside containers.  The end is to enable
the construction of page fragments via the composition of simple building
blocks.  As for Litiom_wizard, it offers routines aiming to automate and
simplify the construction of wizard-like interactions in websites.


2. Dependencies
===============

Litiom depends on Lwt and Ocsigen.


3. Building and installing
==========================

Typing "make" suffices to build the Litiom library.  The build system
relies on Ocamlbuild, and therefore must be used with Ocaml 3.10 or newer.
After building, type "make install" to perform a findlib installation, and
"make apidoc" to build the API documentation.
