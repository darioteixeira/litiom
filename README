1. Overview
===========

Litiom aims to complement Eliom, the web programming framework part of the
Ocsigen project [1].  Litiom is basically a collection of modules offering
high-level constructs for web programming.  Presently, the library contains
only the Litiom_type module, which contains facilities for improving modularity
and abstraction in Eliom applications.


2. Dependencies
===============

Litiom depends on Eliom [1].


3. Building and installing
==========================

The build system relies on OASIS.  The customary sequence of './configure',
'make', and 'make install' is used to build and install the library.  Run
'make doc' to generate the API documentation.


4. License
